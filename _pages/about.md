I study patterns of mutations in the cancer genome. I aim to better understand which mutagenic factors shape these patterns and how they can in return inform therapy selection.

What shapes the tumor mutational landscape?
======
Lifestyle habits and the microbiome can be genotoxic and leave an imprint on tumor DNA. In addition, the immune system can shape the mutational landscape by weeding out cells with too many mutations (a theory called "neoantigen theory").

My work showed for the first time the mutational imprint linking red meat and colorectal cancer.

In addition, I contributed to projects showing (i) for the first time a mutational imprint left by a gut bacterium and (ii) the interplay between a gut bacterium and immune cells.

Can the mutational landscape inform therapy selection?
======

Immunotherapy is effective for several cancer types, however, its clinical use is encumbered by a high variability in patient response.

My work showed the potential pitfalls of an FDA-approved biomarker of immunotherapy response by (i) a meta-analysis of current studies and (ii) the exploratory analysis of a patient's tumor who did not respond to immunotherapy despite the FDA indication.

In addition, I contributed to projects showing (i) the potential use of metabolites to predict response and (ii) a subpopulation of tumor cells resistant to immunotherapy
