title: "Objective 2"
excerpt: "**We leverage mutational landscapes to inform clinical decisions.** Cancer therapies, as well as combinations of them, are being FDA-approved at an increasing rate. Despite being effective for several cancer types, their clinical use is encumbered by a high variability in patient response. Studying the mutational landscape of tumors can inform the best course of treatment, as well as predict the aggresiveness of certain cancers."
