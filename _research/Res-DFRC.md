title: "Millimeter Wave Dual-Function Radar-Communication System"
excerpt: "As a promising technology in beyond-5G (B5G) and 6G, dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) aims to ensure both radar sensing and communication on a single integrated platform with unified signaling schemes. By integrating millimeter wave (mmWave) DFRC and massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO), the DFRC can achieve high-precision sensing while guaranteeing high-throughput communications, which has emerged as a potential enabler for future B5G and 6G. We investigate the DFRC system with low-complexity hardware, intelligent reflecting surface aided DFRC and performance bound analysis of DFRC."

**Abstract:** As a promising technology in beyond-5G (B5G) and 6G, dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) aims to ensure both radar sensing and communication on a single integrated platform with unified signaling schemes. By integrating millimeter wave (mmWave) DFRC and massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO), the DFRC can achieve high-precision sensing while guaranteeing high-throughput communications, which has emerged as a potential enabler for future B5G and 6G. We investigate the DFRC system with low-complexity hardware, intelligent reflecting surface aided DFRC and performance bound analysis of DFRC.
