excerpt: 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the third most common cancer in the world. In the last decade, there has been a concerning trend of early-onset CRC: by 2040, it is predicted to become the leading cause of cancer death in individuals between 20 and 40 years old. Although the reasons for this trend are unclear, diet, in particular red meat consumption, has been hypothesized to play a role. However, no mutagenic role of red meat has been observed in human colons yet. This study presents the mutational signature analysis of a comprehensive CRC molecular profiling study: 900 tumours were sequenced from tissue biopsies collected over four decades. Along with molecular data, this study leveraged detailed information, collected every other year, on the lifestyle of CRC patients. This comprehensive cohort allows us to accurately estimate mutagenic processes in CRC and better understand how they are related to lifestyle factors.'

Several risk factors have been established for colorectal cancer, yet their direct mutagenic effects in patientsâ€™ tumors remain to be elucidated. Here, we leveraged whole-exome sequencing data from 900 colorectal cancer cases that had occurred in three U.S.-wide prospective studies with extensive dietary and lifestyle information. We found an alkylating signature that was previously undescribed in colorectal cancer and then showed the existence of a similar muta- tional process in normal colonic crypts. This alkylating signature is associated with high intakes of processed and unprocessed red meat prior to diagnosis. In addition, this signature was more abundant in the distal colorectum, predicted to target cancer driver mutations KRAS p.G12D, KRAS p.G13D, and PIK3CA p.E545K, and associated with poor survival. Together, these results link for the first time a colorectal mutational signature to a component of diet and further implicate the role of red meat in colorectal cancer initiation and progression.
